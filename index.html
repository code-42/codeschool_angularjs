    1.2 Creating a Store Module 240 pts
    
    The Flatlanders need a store to sell their gems and more! They need it really quick, Angular will do the trick!
    
    They have figured out how to manipulate time and space, allowing them to create three-dimensional gems. The buying and selling of their gems has become a popular Flatlander practice and they believe the next step is taking their wonderful wares to the fourth dimension (the web).
    
    Can you help them reach their online peddling goals?

    1.4 Our First Controller 250 pts
    
    In order to add some behavior to our application, we need a controller. Add a controller named StoreController to our gemStore application.
    
    Add a controller named StoreController to our gemStore application.
    
    Attach the StoreController to the <body> tag. Be sure to alias it as store.
    
    In app.js, we've added a gem object to represent one of the products in our gemStore. Assign it to the product property of StoreController so we can use them in the page.
    
    Display the name of the product inside the <h3> tag.
    
    Display the price of the product inside the <em> tag.


    1.6 Not For Sale 250 pts
    
    We've added two new properties to our product that we can use on the HTML side. The first of these two is canPurchase, which is a boolean indicating if the product can be purchased. The second is soldOut which, as you can imagine, is a boolean indicating if the product is sold out.
    
    Use these two new properties in our HTML page to solve the following objectives.
    
    Use a directive to ensure that we can only see the "Add to Cart" button if the canPurchase property is true.
    
    Our first gem is so popular that we've run out of stock already! Well, Flatlander gems are pretty rare, so it shouldn't be a big surprise. Luckily there is a soldOut property to our gem. When a gem is soldOut, hide the .product element.

  <body class="container" ng-controller="StoreController as store">
    <div class="product row" ng-hide="store.product.soldOut">
      <h3>
        {{store.product.name}}
        <em class="pull-right">${{store.product.price}}</em>
      </h3>
      <button ng-show="store.product.canPurchase">Add to Cart</button>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
